h1. Rally Export Tool

This is a simple tool that reads the XML exports from "Rally":http://www.rallydev.com and spits out a series of story cards ready for print.

h2. Requirements

* "Ruby 1.8.6 or higher":http://www.ruby-lang.org
* "RubyGems 1.1.0 or higher":http://www.rubygems.org
* "Merb 0.9.3 or higher":http://www.merbivore.com
* "Hpricot 0.6 or higher":http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot
* "Morph 0.2.0 or higher":http://rubyforge.org/projects/morph/

You don't need to set up a database.

h2. Installation

Install Ruby, RubyGems and Merb.

Install Hpricot and Morph:

@gem install hpricot@

@gem install morph@

Edit the first line of @rally-export.rb@, look for the line:

@STORIES_XML_LOCATION = "..."@

And point at the place where the Stories.xml file from Rally was downloaded (you can export it from the drop-down menu in the _User Stories_ list). On Windows, use forward slashes (so @C:\foo\bar\stories.xml@ becomes @C:/foo/bar/stories.xml@).

Start the server:

@cd $PATH_TO/rally-export@

@rake@

Go to "@http://localhost:3000@":http://localhost:3000. You should be see a long list of cards. Print it, and you should have 3 3x5 cards per page, ready to be cut and put on your story wall.

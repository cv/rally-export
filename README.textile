h1. Rally Export Tool

This is a simple tool that reads the XML exports from "Rally":http://www.rallydev.com and spits out a series of story cards ready for print.

h2. Requirements

* "Ruby 1.8.6 or higher":http://www.ruby-lang.org
* "RubyGems 1.1.0 or higher":http://www.rubygems.org
* "Ruby On Rails 2.0 or higher":http://www.rubyonrails.org
* "Hpricot 0.6 or higher":http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot
* "Morph 0.2.0 or higher":http://rubyforge.org/projects/morph/

You don't need to set up a database anymore, but future versions may need SQLite 3 installed.

h2. Installation

Install Ruby, RubyGems and Ruby On Rails. Instructions can be found at "this link":http://www.rubyonrails.org/down.

Install Hpricot and Morph:

@gem install hpricot@

@gem install morph@

Edit the @config/environment.rb@ file, look for the line:

@STORIES_XML_LOCATION = "..."@

And point at the place where the Stories.xml file from Rally was downloaded. On Windows, use forward slashes (so @C:\foo\bar\stories.xml@ becomes @C:/foo/bar/stories.xml@)

Start the server:

bq. @cd $PATH_TO/rally-export@
bq. @./script/start # or ruby script\start on Windows@

Go to "@http://localhost:3000/export@":http://localhost:3000/export. You should be see a long list of cards. Print it, and you should have 3 3x5 cards per page, ready to be cut and put on your story wall.
